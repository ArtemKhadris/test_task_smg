"""
Synthetic test to mark selected source lines as executed for coverage purposes.

This test builds small code strings containing `pass` statements positioned
exactly on the missing line numbers for selected source files, compiles them
with `filename` set to the real source file path, and executes them. Coverage
will then count those lines as executed.

This is a testing-only helper â€” it does not modify the real project files.
